            <h2 class="subheader">Accessibility in Web Design</h2>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessibility is an important aspect of web design. Not only does it make it simple and trouble-free for the regular user visiting a website, it also greatly benefits and is necessary for  those with disabilities. That is why web accessibility is something that every web designer should take into account when designing any website.<br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web accessibility is defined by W3C as websites, tools, and technology that is developed for the use of people with disabilities. With these advancements, those with disabilities can “perceive, understand, navigate, interact, and contribute to the Web” and all types of senses are considered, including visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, neurological, and speech [1]. Web accessibility is an advantage to those without disabilities too. There are people who could have poor eyesight, or it could be cases such being on devices with different resolutions. Bad website design is also another problem for every person generally. In order to make accessing your website unaffected by these cases, you can design your website with options and ways to cater to them.<br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, considering what web accessibility is, what can we do when designing websites that would make it accessible to people, especially to those with disabilities? One thing that you should make a habit is to add alt-text to the images on your website. This allows screen-readers used by the visually-impaired to read the alt-text attributed to images to them. Alt-text should be a textual representation of an image so the best way to word alt-text is to describe the image as necessary and include any important information concerning the image, such as the location [2]. For this reason, you should also avoid putting text on images as a way to show text. However, you should consider that images that are less irrelevant to the topic of your web page and are more for visual decoration shouldn’t be labelled with alt-text for the ease of those using screen-readers. <br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important thing to consider is the visuals of your website. As a basis, you should keep your site organized and consistent. The heading tag should be used properly and blocks of texts should be too long. The margins of the page shouldn’t be too wide. It is also significant to consider the use of color on your website. There should be enough color contrast that allows viewers to read text easily and is easy on the eye. Some websites allow users to switch the contrast types of their websites, such as from mostly light with dark text or mostly dark with light text. You should design your website with focus indicators and labels. Focus indicators bring attention to clickable things, such as links, buttons, and inputs, and are beneficial to the visually-impaired individuals and also to the non-disabled. The reason you should add labels with your inputs is because then it is clearer what the input is for [3]. Having focus indicators and labels on your site makes it less complicated to navigate a website so everyone benefits! <br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are additional things you can do to make your website accessible. One of them is to make your website compatible with keyboard navigation and shortcuts. For those who are visually impaired or are physically disabled, this simplifies things. Having your website available in other languages is something else to be considered. This makes your website accessible to people all around the world [3]. <br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing to contemplate when designing your website is how important accessibility is. Web accessibility is something that is crucial to every person which is why we should make it available to those with disabilities too. We should remember that tools and techniques that benefit those with disabilities can also be used by those without disabilities also. That is why accessibility is a great practice that web designers and developers should adopt. <br/>

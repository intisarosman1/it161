            <h2 class="subheader">Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for businesses to increase awareness of their brand and bring in more customers of their products and services, they can make their presence known on social media. From there you can get a large following and an interested audience who will interact with your brand. But before that, you need to be informed about social media optimization.<br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lyfe Marketing, social media optimization is “the process of creating and enhancing your social media plan so that you are able to get measurable results” [1]. Before attempting to create social media for your business, you need to consider what will be successful. You need to consider what social media platforms you will use and what type of audience you’re hoping to gain. Rather than have a presence, you want to build a relationship with your audience. <br/><br/>


            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When choosing social media platforms for your business, you need to consider if they are compatible and if the users of that social media platform would be interested in your brand. For example, business-to-business businesses do the best on LinkedIn [2]. Another example would be that Instagram would be the preferred platform for influencers and advertising the products you sell (ranging from beauty products to photography and art). Youtube is a good way to put your business out there. With Youtube, you can show how to use your products and services, show advertisements, or answer questions regarding your products. After Google, Youtube is the second largest search engine and having your business come up in search results is extremely important for optimization. And the better your business is doing on social media, the more likely you are to do better in search results [2].<br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A way to optimize your business’s social media to be engaging. Not only do you want to get more presence, you also want users to share your content with others. Using hashtags and images in your social media posts tends to mean more interaction. A study by Buffer demonstrated that tweets that have images get 18% more clicks, 89% more likes, and 150% more retweets. Hashtags are important if you want to increase your discoverability but be careful because using too much will make you lose authenticity. It is good to remember that most social media users typically like your content more if you are engaging and entertaining rather than straightforward trying to sell your product [1].<br/><br/>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Roth, there are five steps to social media optimization. The first step is to analyze your audience. You want to know what platforms your target audience prefer and what works for them to be more engaged and interactive with your brand. The second step is to perform a competitive analysis to see how you’re performing against other businesses.The third step is to build a strategy. Based on your analyses, you can incorporate strategies that have worked for you and work for others to allow for more of your own growth. The fourth step is to execute the strategy and put it into action. The fifth step is to analyze your progress and adjust to gain more success [2].<br/><br/>
